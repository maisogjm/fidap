(I) CHECK TARFILE CONTENTS

In addition to this README file, you should see 
an installation script named INSTALL_NIH_FIDAP,
a directory named scripts, a directory named
src, and a directory named docs.

INSTALL_NIH_FIDAP is a C-shell script which installs NIH
fidap for you.

scripts and src contain C-shell scripts and source code
for NIH fidap.

docs contains drafts of sections from a user's guide, still
being written.  They are in MS Word format.

(II) DETERMINE TWO THINGS

To install NIH fidap, you must know two pieces of information. 

(A) First, you must know the name of an ANSI C compiler on your
system, and any optional compilation flags you might desire.

On the SPARCstation on which NIH fidap was developed, I used
a compiler named "acc".  gcc seems to work fine, too.
You might want to use some optimization flags when compiling.
One use attempted to compile NIH fidap using a commercial C
compiler, and found that optimization flags above -O2 seemed
to result in annoying but harmless segmentation faults when
the multiple regression code finished writing out results.
On the version of gcc which I use, -O3 produces no
segmentation faults, however.  On an SGI machine on the
NIH campus, the compiler "cc" worked.

Note that the three X-windows programs, dvt, dvt16, and dvt25
may fail to compile if you don't have the proper X11 libraries
in the expected directories.  You will still be able to run
most of NIH fidap, though.

(B) Second, you must know the name of a directory into which you
want executable shell scripts and compiled code to be placed.
This will be the NIH fidap directory.  You must have write
permissions into this directory, otherwise installation will
fail.  If the directory you have designated does not already
exist, the installation script will attempt to create it.
Obviously, this directory must be accessible by everyone who
is to use NIH fidap at your site.  Note that the total amount
of disk space that the scripts and executables occupy is about
3 Mbytes.

(III) INSTALL

To install, run the script INSTALL_NIH_FIDAP.  It will prompt
you for the above two pieces of information.  If it finishes
without error, all executables will be placed in the designated
directory.

(IV) SET SHELL AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

After installation, there are TWO more things to do for the
accounts of each NIH fidap user.  They both have to do
with the NIH fidap directory (the directory in which you've
installed NIH fidap), determined in (II,B) above:

(A) Most importantly, add the NIH fidap directory to the
Unix search path.  Necessary if one wishes to use NIH fidap.

(B) Add the NIH fidap directory to the environment variable
MATLABPATH.  This is necessary only if you wish to use the
few MATLAB scripts which are bundled in with NIH fidap.
