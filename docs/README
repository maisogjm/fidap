These are ROUGH DRAFTS of sections of an NIH fidap user's guide,
currently being written.  This is not yet complete, but it is
hoped that even in this incomplete state these notes will be
of use.  Future releases of the NIH fidap tarfile will (perhaps!)
contain updated versions.

All files were written using Microsoft Word, except for the file
fidap layout, which was created using MacDraw II.
