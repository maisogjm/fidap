fidap is a set of routines for the processing and analysis of 16-bit
volumetric functional neuroimaging data, written and assembled mostly
by Jose' Ma. Maisog, M.D., under the direction of James V. Haxby,
Ph.D., both of the Section on Functional Brain Imaging, Laboratory of
Brain and Cognition, National Institute of Mental Health.

The file named "fidap" is actually a shell script which calls a menu
driver, also written as a C shell script, which makes calls to other
C-shell scripts, which in turn make calls to executables written in
ANSI C by Dr. Maisog and Dr. Susan Courtney, also of NIMH/LPP/SFBI.
In particular, Dr. Courtney implemented the ANCOVA routines under the
Single-Subject Analysis menu.  In our C code, some calls are made
to routines from Numerical Recipes in C (Press WH, Teukolsky SA,
Vetterling WT, Flannery BP, Numerical Recipes in C, 2nd edition,
1992, Cambridge University Press).  Dr. Peter Jezzard contributed
source code for fMRI reconstruction.  Dr. Allen Song also contributed
source code for fMRI reconstruction, and for the X-windows programs
dvt and dvt16.  Also, Dr. Francois Lalonde has contributed some
C-shell scripts.

I have been careful not to make my C code too complicated, or to
make any calls to architecture-specific libraries, so most of
fidap's C source code should compile easily with an ANSI C compiler.
If you do not have certain X11 libraries, the two X-windows programs
dvt and dvt16 may not compile.  You will still be able to use the
other routines in NIH fidap.

The 3D-registration modules make calls to C code written by
Roger Woods, M.D., Dept. Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine.
The specific programs are alignpettopet16bit, reorient16bit,
reslice16bit, and softmean16bit, which are 16-bit versions of
Dr. Woods' AIR programs alignpettopet, reorient, reslice, and
softmean (AIR version 1.X).  Source code for this software is
NOT included with NIH fidap.  For further information, and to
obtain the AIR programs, contact Dr. Woods at:

           Department of Neurology
           Reed Neurological Research Center
           UCLA School of Medicine
           710 Westwood Plaza
           Los Angeles, California  90024-1769


Note that you will need to modify these three AIR programs to run on
16-bit data; that they should then be renamed alignpettopet16bit,
reorient16bit, reslice16bit, and softmean16bit; and that they should
then be placed in some directory in your UNIX searchpath, in order for
fidap to be able to call them.  See: http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/AIR

We extend thanks to our research assistants Trina Keil, Elizabeth Hoffman,
and Jennifer Schouten for subject recruitment and scheduling, arranging
of experimental stimuli, and assistance in the collection and analysis
of fMRI data; and to Drs. Vincent Clark, Francois Lalonde, and Susan
Courtney for ideas on analysis.  Also, many thanks to Dr. John D. Van
Horn, of the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, National Institute of
Mental Health, for many fruitful and enjoyable discussions about
statistics, signal processing, and science in general.

As more C programs and shell scripts are written they shall be
installed into fidap.  If they are written by other authors,
due credit will of course be given.

fidap is to be used for research purposes only.  While we have
of course run the code on our own data sets and detected and
eliminated many bugs, we cannot guarantee that it has absolutely
no bugs and can accept no responsibility for damages resulting
from the use of fidap.  Make backup copies of all of your data,
and use fidap at your own risk.

If you have questions regarding fidap, please send email
to joem@alw.nih.gov
